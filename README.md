# Zen Bucket

- A decentralized bucket where users deposit their NFT's and provide a list of NFT's they are willing to swap with their NFTs. 
- The bucket will actively look out for any match between two distinct users(offer of one with the consideration of the other). 
- Furthermore, our Dapp will automatically exchange the NFTs when there is a match between two users; thus, users get their desired NFTs without actively golfing for them on marketplaces.
